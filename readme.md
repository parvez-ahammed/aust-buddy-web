# INTRODUCTION

>  ## 1.1 Overview <br>
> 
>  The "AUST BUDDY" project is a university assistant application for different students. This mobile application is built in Android Studio and is developed in kotlin and the database is managed by Firebase.  

>  ## 1.2 Purpose<br>
> 
> This software primarily focuses on maintaining, viewing, saving, and storing the different things of a student to make life easier. As well as some unique features there are also basic features such as user login. After completing a signup form new users can sign in easily. One will be able to register using the university email only and password. It has a facility where a student will be getting different announcements like blood donation requests etc. 
They can also find materials links, Aust website’s, teacher’s info, create groups, post quiz schedules in a group, get bus timings, calculate GPA, bookmark websites, post requests to admin for materials and teachers, create a favorite teacher list, and contact the teachers easily.
Overall, the primary goal of this project is to provide a hassle-free semester for users as well as to save time looking for notes and questions here and there. It will be a valuable asset while taking preparation for the final.


> > ## 1.2.1 Background Study<br>

> > The application is developed for automating the searching of notes, and questions, getting news, and calculating CGPA. The application will be a great relief to the backbencher who’s been chilling the whole semester but wants to ace the finals and also to the nerd who’s trying to score 102% in the final. So won’t it be helpful for the person who’s looking to do average? yes, calculate and analyze your results even before the exams and ace the exam according to that plan!
